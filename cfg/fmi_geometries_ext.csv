# In some cases geometries cannot be found according to their hash. That's because
# the might be some variation how the geometry parameters are expressed. For example,
# a longitude "320" can be also expressed as "-40". That's why have to be able to
# define the same geometries in multiple ways. 

# The "fmi_geometries.csv" file is automatically generated time to time. That's why we
# do not want define our "alternative" geometries there (because they would be overridden). 
# Instead we use this file. This is not a perfect solution, but it would take much
# more time to code a solution that would not use hash calculation. So, we are using
# this for now.
